- ðŸ‘‹ Hey guys I'm CoolPenguin27 (SuperPenguin/SuperPenguin34 on other platforms)

I contributed to Eupnea before QuantumChilipepper (got hacked) deleted the organization and some channels in the official discord.
This is why my forked repos have a different fork source (ex: [ubuntu-rootfs](https://github.com/CoolPenguin27/ubuntu-rootfs) points to [kail-rootfs](https://github.com/natesway/kali-rootfs))
A full backup of the eupnea-linux organization can be found [here](https://github.com/eupnea-linux-backup).
